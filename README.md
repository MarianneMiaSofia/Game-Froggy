## Game title: Froggy

Platform: Windows

Number of players: 1

## Game Story
The frog lives in its home swamp and needs food. However, the frog must be careful as cats have discovered the swamp!

## Game Idea and Objectives
The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by feeding the frog insects and butterflies. Insects give the player 1 point and butterflies give 5 points. If a cat catches the frog, the game ends immediately.

The frog character is controlled via keyboard commands (arrow keys), while the insects and the cat move along random paths on the game platform.
